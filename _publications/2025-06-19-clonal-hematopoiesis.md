We derived DNA from PBMCs (buffy coat) and saliva and cfDNA from plasma, designed a high-coverage capture panel to detect CH mutations, and performed an analytical validation study targeting the coding regions of 19 genes associated with CH. The assay identified 94.71% of variants at standard depth (1,000X) and 100% of cases at high depth (10,000X).
