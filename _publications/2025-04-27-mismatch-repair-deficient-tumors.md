Among patients with mismatch repair–deficient, locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade eliminated the need for surgery in a high proportion of patients. Among the 49 patients in the rectal cohort, 100% achieved complete clinical responses, and 96% were recurrence-free at 2 years. Among the 54 patients with nonrectal tumors, 65% had complete clinical responses, with a 2-year recurrence-free survival rate of 85%.
