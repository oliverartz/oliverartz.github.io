I have been a molecular genticist for almost a decade working to better understand how organisms react to environmental conditions. My research mainly focussed on the molecular mechanisms enabling the perception of light and adaptive developmental responses. My great enthusiasm for RNA biology and bioinformatic approaches led me to delve deep into the world of transcriptomics and epitranscriptomics. I am seeking to leverage my expertise in molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry to guide, innovate, and conduct bioinformatics analyses, thus making a real-world impact.
